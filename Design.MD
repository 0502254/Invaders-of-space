# Project Overview 
My game is a recreation of Space Invaders with my own custom player and enemies 
## Future Additions
Later in my game I plan on creating different enemies types that vary from weak and fast to strong and slow. I also plan on adding boss fights in some levels to create a challange for the player.
## Player and Enemy Weapons 
Every 5th level I want to give the players different type of weapons like misses, shotguns and lasers but to obtain these weapons the player must defeat a boss at the end of the level
